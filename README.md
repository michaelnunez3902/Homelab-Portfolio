# Homelab-Portfolio
This repository documents my personal homelab environment and the hands-on projects I’ve built to develop practical IT systems administration and cybersecurity skills. The lab is designed to simulate real-world enterprise environments, allowing safe testing, troubleshooting, hardening, and documentation of systems.
